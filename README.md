# Privacy Policy for SZ EZ-Vote

## Last Updated: January 20, 2026

Thank you for using the __SZ EZ-Vote__ Chrome extension ("the Extension"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle information when you use our Extension.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy is designed to be transparent about the limited data we collect, which is strictly for the purpose of maintaining and improving the Extension's functionality.

### 1. Information We Collect

We have designed this Extension to collect as little data as possible. We __do not collect__ any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, browsing history, or passwords.

### 2. Third-Party Services (Google Analytics)

To improve the stability and performance of the Extension, we use __Google Analytics__ to collect anonymous, aggregate usage data. This data helps us identify bugs, monitor performance, and understand how the Extension is being used.

The information collected includes:

* __Error Logs__: Information about crashes or errors that occur within the Extension (e.g., if a specific feature fails).

* __Usage Metrics__: Aggregate data on which features are used most frequently (e.g., enable tab groups option, etc.).

Google Analytics may use cookies or similar technologies to help us analyze how the Extension is used.

* __Google's Privacy Policy__: You can learn more about how Google uses data by visiting [Google's Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

* __Opt-Out__: If you wish to opt out of Google Analytics data collection, you can install the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### 3. How We Use Information

The limited anonymous data we collect is used solely for the following purposes:

* __Debugging__: To identify and fix technical issues, bugs, or crashes within the Extension.

* __Stability__: To monitor the health and performance of the Extension across different browser versions.

* __Improvement__: To ensure the Extension works reliably for all users.

### 4. Data Security

We prioritize the security of your information. Because we do not collect PII, there is no risk of your personal data being exposed via our Extension. The anonymous error data is stored securely within the Google Analytics infrastructure, which adheres to industry-standard security protocols.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
